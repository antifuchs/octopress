Two days ago, I [announced](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1205) the freeze of the current code base of [mcclim](http://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/). All in all, that doesn't sound like it's much different from the [previous freeze](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1142/focus=1142) (which [failed](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1158)), but this time:

* The freeze period is much shorter - projected release date is November 2nd;
* Both the [test status](http://mcclim.cliki.net/0.9.3%20Status) as well as the [release notes](http://mcclim.cliki.net/0.9.3%20Release%20Notes) are on the mcclim cliki, and visible to all.
* I actually have the time and the energy to take care of these things.

I hope that this time, it will work out. 

If you want to test mcclim before we release, feel free to report your results on IRC, on the [test status page](http://mcclim.cliki.net/0.9.3%20Status), or on the [mcclim-devel mailing list](http://common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/mcclim-devel).
