OK OK, [time](http://www.kiranbot.com/2015-reading-log/) to join in
[the](https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/the-best-of-what-i-read-in-2015-ae3491444a5a#.uf7sk9qms)
book review fun.

All these are from memory and goodreads, so I hope you'll forgive me
if I miss one or two. You'll notice I didn't list almost no
non-fiction here - that's because I didn't manage to finish any except
one this year. Whoops. Correcting this is on my list of things to do
in 2016.

### My favorites

* [Sorcerer to the Crown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25104078-sorcerer-to-the-crown)
  by Zen Cho - a super fun alternate history story set in England
  during the Napoleonic wars. I loved many things about this book, but
  my favorite is the way characters in it use the word "exploded".

* [The Fifth Season](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19887474-the-fifth-season)
  by N. K. Jemisin - this reads like a post-apocalyptic (or maybe
  meso-apocalyptic?) fantasy story, but comes with a bunch of sci-fi
  elements. I don't know if I can say many more non-spoiler things
  about this other than that I loved it. Can't wait for the sequel.

* [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18245960-the-three-body-problem)
  and
  [The Dark Forest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24375664-the-dark-forest)
  by Liu Cixin - these were two pretty great hard SF reads. The second
  one has a super cringe-worthy stretch, but overall, I enjoyed it
  more than the first - the two books almost feel like they are set in
  different genres. These are on my (very very short) pile of books to
  re-read eventually. Do yourself a favor and catch up: I suspect
  we'll see winks and nods to the series in other works soon.

* [The Book of Phoenix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24779771-the-book-of-phoenix)
  by Nnedi Okorafor - I loved
  [Who Fears Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7767021-who-fears-death),
  and Book of Phoenix ends up being a prequel. I got a distinct
  "[Falling out of Cars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383089-falling-out-of-cars)"
  feeling from some parts, but Okorafor weaves in and handles a bunch
  more themes like colonialism, scientific misconduct and white
  entitlement to black bodies. It's amazingly written and I loved it
  all.

* [Ancillary Mercy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24966740-ancillary-mercy)
  by Ann Leckie - I *loved* this book. It's the last one in a trilogy,
  and of course, you should read them all. Especially if you love
  awkward conversations over tea.

### Pretty good books

* [A Key, an Egg, an Unfortunate Remark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24237682-a-key-an-egg-an-unfortunate-remark)
  by Harry Connolly - pacifist Urban Fantasy. Probably my favorite
  twist on a genre so far (and it works *remarkably* well).

* [The Internet Of Garbage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25910742-the-internet-of-garbage)
  by [Sarah Jeong](http://twitter.com/sarahjeong) - OMFG a non-fiction
  book! On this list! And it's really great, too. You really should
  read this if you build systems that let people talk to each other.

* [Spirits Abroad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23837692-spirits-abroad)
  by Zen Cho - short stories featuring monsters and spirits from
  Malaysia. Some are extremely touching, and some are hilarious and
  some are both. My favorite was "House of Aunts".

* [Sunshine Patriots](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21215959-sunshine-patriots)
  by Bill Campbell - holy carp, this book is a gut punch. Great
  commentary on the jingoistic american war machine and all the
  structures supporting it. A lot of repulsive things are going on in
  this one (TWs for rape and many more war-related atrocities). I
  couldn't say any of the themes are out of line with how I'd project
  the US will be fighting their wars in that future.

* [Elysium](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23688037-elysium) by
  Jennifer Marie Brissett - this read like a weird and not-really
  pleasant fever dream. The writing was great, and I loved
  the plot.

* [Nemesis Games](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886612-nemesis-games)
  (The Expanse, #5) by James S. A. Corey - Spaceships for the
  spaceship god. Good. I'll keep reading. (They made this series
  [a TV show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) recently - it's
  not terrible!)

### Not for me

* [The Annihilation Score](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24601568-the-annihilation-score)
  (Laundry Files, #6) by Charles Stross - I read all the books in this
  series, and starting to show its age. By swapping out the
  (ridiculously overpowered) protagonist for another (not-quite-as
  ridiculously overpowered) protagonist, it ended up working out
  fine... but if I am completely honest, I'm reading this series out
  of habit, not because I'm particularly enjoying it anymore.

* [Fluency](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22566044-fluency) by
  Jennifer Wells - this was ok, but I'll skip the sequel.

* [Ascension](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18277661-ascension)
  by Jacqueline Koyanagi - didn't really click for me.

* [The Goblin Emperor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17404280-the-goblin-emperor)
  by Katherine Addison - reading this book felt like a chore and
  didn't come with any pay-off in the end. Try it if you love
  memorizing names.

* [Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16096522-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore)
  by Robin Sloan - this is what happens if you give San Francisco tech
  workers a copy of Cryptonomicon to read. Don't do that. (Seriously
  though, it's a fun read, despite being extremely predictable and
  cringe-y.  The author sadly has nothing even close to Stephenson's
  exposition compensation field.)

## Next up

I am looking forward to a bunch of (partially read and unstarted) books in 2016!

* [Einfach Ãœben](http://www.amazon.de/Einfach-%C3%BCben-%C3%9Cberezepte-Instrumentalisten-Studienbuch/dp/3795787246) -
  I am learning how to learn to play an instrument, and this book has
  a bunch of interesting things to say about how we learn to play
  music in particular, but also how good practice in general can shape
  your performance. I'm excited to use the things I learn from it.

* [Venus Siegt](http://www.amazon.de/Venus-siegt-Dietmar-Dath/dp/3941978187) -
  german Sci Fi. All I know is that this book has space stalinists. Intrigued.

* [The Obelisk Gate](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01922I1GG) -
  the aforementioned sequel to The Fifth Season.
