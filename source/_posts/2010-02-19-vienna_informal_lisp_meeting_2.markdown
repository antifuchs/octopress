I'm pleased to announce the first international totally informal lisp meeting in Vienna. A bunch of Lisp hackers are coming to here on the 27th, and we will meet, talk and hack in and around the Metalab.

The approximate schedule is as follows:

*12:30* - Lunch at [Fromme Helene](http://www.frommehelene.at/). There is a table reserved for 15 persons (we're 5 confirmed hackers at the moment). If you want in, drop me a line.  
~*14:30* - Reconvene at the Metalab for hacking/coffee/cold drinks/(optional) lightning talks

Hackers who have confirmed they'll be there, so far:

* Tobias C. Rittweiler
* Luke Gorrie
* Stelian Ionescu
* Attila Lendvai
* GÃ¡bor Melis
* Mark Evenson

Thanks to the SBCL team for infusing this event with positive energy. SBCL: Harming the software industry since 1999.
