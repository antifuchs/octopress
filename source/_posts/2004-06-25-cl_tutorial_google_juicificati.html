 <p>A google search for Lisp tutorials often doesn&#8217;t yield a useful result
for a newbie: Lots of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lisp%20tutorial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Tutorials from the late 90s and 80s</a>. Most call
it &#8220;LISP&#8221; (in capitals), and refer to &#8220;the interpreter&#8221;. This does
not reflect reality any more. Here are some more useful introductions
to Common Lisp:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.unmutual.info/startingwithcl.html">Learning Lisp, the #lisp yabo way</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp: upcoming book on CL by Peter Seibel.</a> - <em>highly</em> recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://ww.telent.net/lisp/according_to/">a short introduction to setting up SBCL and SLIME for new CL users</a> by Dan Barlow</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps direct the google juice into more modern channels.</p>
