[This](http://undefined.com/ia/2006/10/27/six-word-stories-about-programming-languages/) made me laugh:

> **COBOL:** Without me there wouldn’t be PCs.

> **FORTRAN:** Without me there wouldn’t be H-Bombs.

Oh, and the lisp story in [Pupeno](http://pupeno.com/)'s [comment](http://undefined.com/ia/2006/10/27/six-word-stories-about-programming-languages/#comment-886) is way better than the one in the original article.
