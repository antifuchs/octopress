I did a preview demo of the text search visualizer ([see](http://boinkor.net/archives/2007/03/simple_visualization_tool_for.html)) today and achieved understanding in one other person. Yay! 

[Here](http://boinkor.net/lisp/algorithm-visualization/text-search) is the source (with git repository) of the updated text search visualization tool, now featuring [Michael's](http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/log/programming/lisp/kmp-search) Knuth-Morris-Pratt search implementation and actually helpful help text.
