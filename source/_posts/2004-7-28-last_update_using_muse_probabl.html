 <p>Lisp content first: I added a few features to the
<a href="http://sbcl.boinkor.net/benchmarks">SBCL auto-benchmarker</a>: When it encounters compile errors in the last
revision, it sends an irritating mail to sbcl-devel (currently, to
me, so that I can test and extend the auto-irritation levels a bit
more).</p>

<p>Right. And now for some real-world stuff. There is now a <a href="http://boinkor.net/pix">Picture album</a>
online, which is semi-automatically updated from my digicam. Included
are a few shots of our mouldy toilet. Apparently, our neighbor&#8217;s
toilet&#8217;s water pipe broke. 5. weeks. ago. We noticed the mould last
wednesday. You can see the result in
<a href="http://boinkor.net/pix/schimmel/">The &#8220;schimmel&#8221; section of the album</a>. I wonder whose fault it was that
repairing the broken pipe took so long. Anyway, As soon as we called
the property manager (to whom the toilet belongs - for various
reasons), they sent a plumber over who fixed it; of course, there is
still the <a href="http://boinkor.net/pix/schimmel/slides/imgp0441.html">slightly</a> <a href="http://boinkor.net/pix/schimmel/slides/imgp0437.html">mouldy</a> <a href="http://boinkor.net/pix/schimmel/slides/imgp0439.html">wall</a> to be fixed. Ah well, some people had
better not pass me by in the next few days, lest they risk hearing my
opinion, which might not please them very much.</p>

<p>In other news, this is probably the last update to this journal with
Muse; I think I&#8217;ll switch to <a href="http://www.hellinahandbasket.org/blog/">Chandler&#8217;s</a> neat blogging engine.</p>
