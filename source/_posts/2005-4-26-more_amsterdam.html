<p>Time to write up how I experienced the <a href="http://weitz.de/meeting">Amsterdam Lisp meeting</a>. Summary: had a great time. The combination of gorgeous weather, lots of interesting people, good food, and lisp content might have helped there, I guess.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Friday was weird. Airports, planes, trains and a hotel that, despite having confirmed my reservation for a room, had to relocate me to another hotel because they were full. After the initial shock of suddenly having a 1/2 hour&#8217;s commute to the city center, I spent some time wandering around there and meeting up with a few people (Juho, Antonio Martinez, Tim Daly Jr. and quite a few others) in a cute cafe that happens to serve belgian beer. I had to go back to my room and fall into bed way too early, though. (<em>Hours</em> before midnight!)</p></li>
<li><p>On Saturday, I met up with a few of last night&#8217;s lispers to visit the Heineken Museum. That exhibitions reminded me a bit of Duff Gardens, except that it was indoors and lacked the quality of being an intentional parody. Did you know that Heineken engineers once tried to make a brick-shaped beer bottle, so that it could be used as a building block for houses in development countries? Turns out that in the countries they targeted, the sun is so hot that you can&#8217;t live in a house made of glass. Their beer trivia terminals tell you that.</p>

<p>Later, we went to the Van Gogh Museum and looked at the <a href="http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/gehring/Schiele/SchieleGalerie0.html">Egon Schiele</a> (<a href="http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/gehring/Schiele/SchieleGalerie0.html">gallery</a>) exhibition there (as well as a few pictures by Van Gogh in the main exhibition hall). After that, fetched my digicam and walked from Stadhouderskade to the <a href="http://www.kantjil.nl/">Kantjil &amp; de Tijger</a>, photographing everything that caught my eye. Had great dinner there (the entire table was covered by plates full of extremely tasty food!) and then went to Robert Strandh&#8217;s (and others&#8217;, in fact) Hotel to talk about CLIM stuff in the hotel bar. There we heard what I think is the best explanation of incremental redisplay yet. Physical presence of people who understand a concept really helps. (-:</p></li>
<li><p>Sunday was Lispmeet day. I had thought that the people I had seen at saturday&#8217;s dinner were the most lispers I had ever met. Imagine my surprise when I wandered into the meeting room. Here&#8217;s a list of the most important notes I took during the talks:</p>

<ul>
<li>During the <a href="http://lispworks.com">LispWorks</a> talk, I had a few ideas for a CLIM frontend to ASDF defsystems. The first of these ideas is ripping off Lispworks&#8217; defsystem browser. (-:</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> talk made me realize (again) how few functions I use in slime. M-x slime-edit-variable and the package apropos function are way cool. Must practice using them.</li>
<li><a href="http://meme.b9.com/cview.html?channel=lisp&amp;start=3323481884&amp;end=3323481905">For the sake of our children</a>, I will continue to pronounce climacs as &#8220;klee-macs&#8221;.</li>
<li>Had lunch at a small place called &#8220;Lust&#8221; with Robert, Kathleen and David Lichteblau. They serve pretty good food and mint tea with real mint. I can&#8217;t remember the street name, though. Might have been Runstraat (first crossroad south of the <a href="http://www.felix.meritis.nl/">Felix Meritis</a>). Recommended if you&#8217;re in Amsterdam. <strong>Update (and note to self):</strong> Turns out it <em>is</em> Rumstraat. They have a <a href="http://www.lustamsterdam.nl/">web site</a>, too.</li>
<li>I was very impressed by the <a href="http://www.evaluator.pt/">Linj</a> talk held by Antonio Menezes Leitao. A friend said that compiling a subset of idiomatic lisp to human-readable idiomatic java only makes sense in a world that is very weird already. It is, and so I&#8217;m very happy that this project is around to save me from writing java the next time I would normally have to. (-:</li>
<li>I won one of the 19 (18?) <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book">Practical Common Lisp</a> books that Peter Seibel brought to Amsterdam and signed there! Spent the entire monday afternoon (well, the parts of the afternoon that I didn&#8217;t spend sleeping) blissfully reading it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Monday was planes and airports again and reading PCL, interrupted by irregular sleeping.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, yours truly had a very fine weekend just like <a href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2005/4/#26.35784">all</a> <a href="http://www.iki.fi/jsnell/blog/archive/2005-04-26.html">the</a>
<a href="http://lispmeister.com/blog/lisp-news/eclm-2005.html">other</a> <a href="http://pvaneynd.blogspot.com/2005/04/european-common-lisp-meeting.html">europlanet.lispers</a>. The only thing I missed was more time to talk to all the extremely interesting people that I met there. I do hope there is going to be another lisp meeting next year! (-:</p>
