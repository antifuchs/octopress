I've just made the jump from a creaky, old, badly-styled and annoying Movable Type installation to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It looks pretty nice, and as of now works better than MT has ever worked here, although I hope I didn't break too many things with the switch over. If you find any 404s where they shouldn't be, please contact me.
