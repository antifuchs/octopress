We [released](http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mcclim-announce/2007-January/000004.html) McCLIM 0.9.4 today. You may be wondering what's so cool about it this time, so here's a short list:

* A new input editor and editing substrate called DREI (covered [here before](http://boinkor.net/archives/2006/11/drei_revives_eremites_interest.html)),
* several great improvements to gtkairo (see [lisp porn here](http://sigkill.dk/athas/gtkairoshots/)), and
* many cool new features and bug fixes, including a few clim 2.2 functions.

(Of course, there are probably lots of new bugs in there, too. Please let us know about them at mcclim-devel at common-lisp.net!)

(And of course, the release announcement has the obligatory editing-under-stress error. You will get the following reward for finding it:<br/>
