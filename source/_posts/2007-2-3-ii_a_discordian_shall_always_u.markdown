Yay [memes](http://bc.tech.coop/blog/070203.html)! I've been tagged, and not in the comfortably [delicious](http://del.icio.us) way. 

1. I hoped for a long time to somehow avoid [compulsory military service](http://www.bmlv.gv.at/). When I no longer cared about it, they let me go because I had flat feet.

2. I like caffeine, but I hate coffee.

3. In 2000, I wrote a several-kilobyte big two-dimensional bin-packing program in Scheme. The whole program is a good candidate for a [Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com) front-page post. My favorite is the function named `get-fits`.

4. Weird [synchronicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) seems to follow me around.

5. I am an Atheist, and a [Discordian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism). Disbelief is a very unserious business.

In order to avoid planet.lispy combinatorial explosion (and further in-breeding of this meme), I'll tag [boinkmarks](http://sbcl.boinkor.net/bench/) feeds `baker/SBCL:emulated-x86/(:sb-thread)`, `elgar/SBCL:ppc-on-ppc64`, `elgar/SBCL:ppc-on-ppc64/((not :gencgc))`, `walrus.boinkor.net/SBCL:x86`, `baker/CLISP:x86_64` instead of the few planet.lisp bloggers that are still missing (Xof, rudi -- you are memetically free for another day). Expect their statements in a few days.
