      <p>Right now, I&#8217;m filling this site with content. This can take a pretty
long time, so don&#8217;t curse me for wasting your time now. Curse me for
wasting much more of your time <em>later</em>.</p>

<p>So, a bit of information about this site might be in order: It&#8217;s
supposed to be the successor to the mildly successful
(http://asf.void.at/), the site for which my write access suddenly
disappeared. At least you can still see it. Perhaps I&#8217;ll salvage it
for your mocking pleasure.</p>

<p>The last site was done in <a href="http://www.latte.org/">Latte 1.x</a>, and it was bearable to manage
it. Still, I mixed content and presentation often enough that I just
did not bother to update it. This site is made with <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/johnw/">John Wiegley</a>&#8217;s
neat <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/johnw/programs.html#sec3">muse</a> system. This should make it easier to put up content here.</p>
