As a pleasant side-effect from [CLISP boinkmarks](http://boinkor.net/archives/2006/11/clisp_boinkmarks_available.html) availability, I can now make available a git-ified clone of CLISP's CVS repository that is synced once every hour.

To use it, point your [git](http://git.or.cz) or [cogito](http://git.or.cz/cogito/) client at `git://sbcl.boinkor.net/clisp`. If you want to browse the commits, tags and branches, you can get a gitweb summary (with rss!) [here](http://sbcl.boinkor.net/gitweb?p=clisp.git;a=summary).

Of course, tips I posted about the git-ified SBCL on this blog before (like the one about [finding bugs by using git bisect](http://boinkor.net/archives/2006/11/using_git_bisect_to_locate_bug_1.html)) apply to the git-ified CLISP as well!
