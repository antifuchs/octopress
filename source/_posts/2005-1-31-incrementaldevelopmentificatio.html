<p>Upgrading <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/">McCLIM</a> (or even hacking on it) is hard work for your
computer. That&#8217;s due to the use of <code>:serial t</code> in the
system definition that manages to be compatible to <a href="http://cliki.net/asdf/">ASDF</a> (which has an
idea of &#8220;real&#8221; dependencies) and other defsystems (for example,
<a href="http://cliki.net/mk-defsystem">MK:DEFSYSTEM</a> and the ones in LispWorks and Allegro CL) because of
this.</p>

<p>So whenever you update a file, your defsystem must recompile all the
files that are listed after it in the McCLIM system definition. This
can result in 20 files that need to be recompiled for changes to a
file that only 6 files actually depend on.</p>

<p>This has resulted in lots of gnashing of teeth from people who want to
spend their time hacking cool stuff with McCLIM, and less time waiting
for it to finish compiling.</p>

<p>(Here&#8217;s the bragging part. Skip below for actual code.) So I
sat down and wrote a bit of awful code, which essentially does this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find out which &#8220;interesting&#8221; symbols a defsystem&#8217;s components use</li>
<li>Find out which components use which symbols (establishing
file->symbols and symbol->files mappings)</li>
<li>Order the components according to the existing :serial definition
and use the first component for group of files as the dependency
target for the others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This (and the symbol finder, which really wants to be an XREF thing)
is a bit conservative, in that it generates dependencies when in doubt
- if a file uses <code>CLIMI::Q</code> and another file uses CLIMI::Q as a
temporary variable, the code emits a dependency. But then, the
resulting system definition works as good as the original
mcclim/system.lisp file worked for me.</p>

<p>(Skip to this point to escape the bragging part.) You can get the ASDF
system definition that i tested from <a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/5396#4">lisppaste</a>, at. Just replace mcclim&#8217;s
system.lisp file with it and load the components as you normally
would. I would like to hear from you if it works or breaks for
you. Tell me at #lisp / irc.freenode.net. I&#8217;m &#8220;antifuchs&#8221;.</p>

<p>Things to test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building &#8220;from scratch&#8221;: remove all .fasl files and rebuild with
the new system definition in place</li>
<li>reloading a system after files have changed: touch random .lisp
files and <code>(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clim) ; for example</code></li>
</ul>
