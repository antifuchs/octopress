We released [McCLIM](http://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/) 0.9.3, code-named "All Souls' Day" today. Most prominently, this release:

* Plugs a horrible memory leak in incremental redisplay, along with a few optimizations.
* Has a new backend, gtkairo (uses GTK for gadgets, and Cairo for rendering)
* Includes lots and lots of bug fixes and new features.

The "haha, this is embarrassing" department mentions that my brain misfired while sending the release announcement. I wrote ["All Saints' Day"](http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mcclim-announce/2006-November/000002.html) instead of "All Souls' Day". This is now [corrected](http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mcclim-announce/2006-November/000003.html).
