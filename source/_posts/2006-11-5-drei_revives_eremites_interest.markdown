[Troels Henriksen](http://sigkill.dk/blog/) has [made available](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1216) his modifications to McCLIM: He added an input editor (named "DREI") that is based on [climacs](http://common-lisp.net/project/climacs/). The greater plan seems to be to make Climacs use that input editor for all its editing panes.

Apart from less code duplication and embeddability of a really nice emacs in every clim application that uses a text-editor gadget, this adds a few cool things to the input editing in current clim applications. This screen shot

shows:

* Lisp syntax highlighting,
* (almost) correct indentation of forms, and
* nicely formatted "noise" strings: *(pathname)*.
