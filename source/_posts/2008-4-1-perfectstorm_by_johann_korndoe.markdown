This isn't original work, so perhaps more suited to being in my [soup](http://mublag.boinkor.net) than this blog, but it's so cool it just has to be on Planet Lisp. [perfectstorm](http://erleuchtet.org/2008/03/project-overview-perfectstorm.html) is:

> a real time strategy game study written in Common Lisp using OpenGL for graphics display and cairo for texture generation.

Looks very very interesting. Google SoC students take note: this is an open source project (-:
