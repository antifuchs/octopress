<li>The problem of <a href="http://gnuarch.org">Arch</a> is that its main implementation was once a shell script and is now a C program.</li>
<li>The problem of <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">Darcs</a> is that once you get over the QUANTUM PHYSICS shock, it&#8217;s just another version control system.</li>
<li>The problem of <a href="http://cvshome.org">CVS</a> is that you don&#8217;t want to know why it works.</li>
<li>The problem of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> is more of the same.</li>
</ul>
