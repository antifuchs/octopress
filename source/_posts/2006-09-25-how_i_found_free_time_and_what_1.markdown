Busy busy! (This post contains references to at least three things related to lisp, so into this category it goes)

It's been several months since the last post. Since then, I was in [Hamburg](http://weitz.de/eclm2006), St. Petersburg, and Helsinki. I hacked on a few lisp projects (an asdf dependency groveller of which I'm proud, and a new cl pathname system of which I'm planning to be proud), and rotated jobs. I am a consultant in lispy things now. Yay! That [doesn't](http://trac.cyberduck.ch/ticket/75) mean I get to hack only on lisp code, though.

Read two or three dozen books. Highlights: lots of stuff by [Charles Stross](http://antipope.org/charlie/), [The Lost Cosmonaut](http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/travel/story/0,,1730709,00.html) and Warren Ellis's Fell ([issue one available for free here](http://www.newsarama.com/ImageComics/Fell/Fell01Issue.htm)). [Promised](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1142/focus=1142) a mcclim release and promptly [missed the deadline](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.mcclim.devel/1158). Got a Mac. Am now installing [grml](http://grml.org) in [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) on it. Went to a funeral and missed a wedding. Am enthusiastic about [metalab](http://metalab.at/wiki/English). Read lots of irrelevant stuff  on the internet (like the entry you're reading now). 

Promise less disinformation density soon.
