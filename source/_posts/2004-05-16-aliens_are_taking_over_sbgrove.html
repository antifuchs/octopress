<p>I spent the last few months of my spare time hacking on <a href="http://boinkor.net/SB-GROVEL.html">SB-GROVEL</a>,
trying to port its structure types from the C-like simplicity (and
simple-mindedness that comes with non-typechecked data) to
SB-ALIEN. There are a few memory leaks in other contribs, now. (The
previous SB-GROVEL used lisp objects that are garbage collected, the
new one doesn&#8217;t. Choose your poison!)</p>

<p>I think it was worth the effort. Foreign Function definitions can now
use the neat alien types, and don&#8217;t have to rely on (* t) types where
they&#8217;d expect a structure. And application programmers now get usable
alien objects back, without having to frob them through
SB-INT::FOREIGN-ARRAY or whatever. Yay!</p>
