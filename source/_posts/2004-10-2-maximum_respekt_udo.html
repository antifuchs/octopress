 <p>Just returned from watching <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/udo77/">Udo 77</a>, the musical about Udo Proksch
(<a href="http://www.monochrom.at/english/2004/09/monochrom-update-udo-77-our-udo.htm">here</a>&#8217;s the monochrom blog entry with some background information on
him).</p>

<p>Much fun was had by all (including the actors!). Key highlights: a gay
love story between two computer programs
(<a href="http://meme.b9.com/cview.html?channel=lisp&amp;utime=3304781026#utime_requested">singing a love song in english, though</a>), really pretty good music,
sarcastic technobabble that was funny even if you know a bit about
computers. No lisp, though.</p>

<p>So, the obligatory lisp content in this journal entry. <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/">Iterate</a> has a
new home, and also a <a href="http://common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/iterate-devel">mailing list</a>. If you want to know more about it,
help us develop it, or just like to hang around in cool places, feel
free to join.</p>

<p>Also, make the &#8220;probably&#8221; in the last entry title an &#8220;I wish&#8221;.</p>
