<p>I just rediscovered a pretty good Lisp tutorial - ELM-ART (<a href="http://apsymac33.uni-trier.de:8080/elm-art/login-d">german
version</a>, <a href="http://apsymac33.uni-trier.de:8080/art/login-e.html">english version</a>). My first contact was
sometime early in 2003, when somebody else (could have been <a href="http://lispm.dyndns.org/news.html">Rainer
Joswig</a>) gave me the link and I
tried it out.</p>

<p>The whole tutorial is very well presented, and it includes exercises
which you can solve interactively. The system also gives you feedback
on errors in your code.</p>

<p>I found the whole ELM-ART (Episodic Learner Model / Adaptive Remote
Tutor) concept pretty interesting, and found that the <a href="http://www.uni-trier.de">Uni
Trier</a>&#8217;s ELM group published a few papers on
it. In case you&#8217;re interested, here are links to the papers that I
could dig up:</p>

<ul>
<li>1996: &#8220;ELM-ART: An Intelligent Tutoring System on World Wide Web&#8221;
(<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~plb/ITS96.html">html</a>)</li>
<li>2001: &#8220;ELM-ART: An Adaptive Versatile System for Web-based
Instruction&#8221;
(<a href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~peterb/papers/JAIEDFinal.pdf">pdf</a>
<a href="http://aied.inf.ed.ac.uk/members01/archive/vol_12/weber/full.html">html</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway. Don&#8217;t mind the underlying technology. It&#8217;s a pretty good
low-level tutorial. Still, for a more extensive treatment of Common
Lisp, you should get Peter Seibel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common
Lisp</a> or Peter Norvig&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.norvig.com/paip.html">PAIP</a>.</p>
