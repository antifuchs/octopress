<p>It&#8217;s not like Muse is a bad program or anything, but in the last year of using it, I&#8217;ve had a few (HTML) compliance issues too many. Another problem was that there are a few things that are really hard to express in a plain text file &#8212;- there are better user interfaces for things like a change date (and a creation date).</p>

<p>Anyway, I installed movabletype now. I think I should I feel a little guilty now for using something non-lispy (in fact, dumping something lispy for a perl thing). But then, the perl thing works better and does most of the things that I want. Hey, at least it&#8217;s not PHP! (-;</p>
