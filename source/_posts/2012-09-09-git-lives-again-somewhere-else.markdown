I've revived the git repos affected by
[this outage](http://boinkor.net/archives/2012/08/git-dot-boinkor-dot-net-outage.html)
- the cvs->git conversion is now alive again, and the repos there are
now kept on [github.com](https://github.com/antifuchs/).

Turns out there are only two more CVS repos left that I was converting
to git: [McCLIM](https://github.com/antifuchs/mcclim) and
[SLIME](https://github.com/antifuchs/slime). So, they're online again,
and I hope you still find them useful.

If you are missing any repos that I forgot to move, please send me a
note. I should have extensive backups of everything, so restoring
anything that's missing probably isn't a problem. (Famous last words,
hah!)
