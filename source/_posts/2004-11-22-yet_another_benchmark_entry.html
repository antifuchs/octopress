 <p>A few months ago, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/crhodes/">Christophe</a> suggested that
autobuilding/autobenchmarking of <a href="http://clisp.cons.org">CLisp</a> would be nice to have in
<a href="http://sbcl.boinkor.net/benchmark/">Boinkmarks</a>. I tried, but couldn&#8217;t make it fit into the ugly bunch of
shell scripts. This was when I decided to rewrite them in Common
Lisp, and to add a nice web interface using <a href="http://ww.telent.net/araneida/">araneida.</a></p>

<p>That is now finished. See the results at
<a href="http://sbcl.boinkor.net/benchmark/">http://sbcl.boinkor.net/benchmark/</a> (<a href="http://sbcl.boinkor.net/benchmark.old/">old version</a>, for contrast).</p>

<p>So, was it worth it? The rewrite doesn&#8217;t bring me that much closer to
my goal of actually benchmarking CLisp; but adding that functionality
is now much easier with the new CLOS-based protocol for
building/caching/benchmarking implementation binaries (especially when
compared to these <a href="http://boinkor.net/misc/boinkmarks/run-benchmark-for">ugly</a> <a href="http://boinkor.net/misc/boinkmarks/plot">shell</a> <a href="http://boinkor.net/misc/boinkmarks/build-this-version">constructs</a>). Another great advantage is
that I now have a chance of understanding what I have written when I
have to fix it in a few months.</p>

<p>Watch this space, there are a few benchmarking-related announcements
waiting to be made in the near future (the release of the benchmarking
tool, for one) (-:</p>
