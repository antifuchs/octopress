<p>At last I managed to release Autobench, the incremental benchmark
runner that powers http://sbcl.boinkor.net/bench/. Get it at
<a href="http://boinkor.net/lisp/autobench/autobench-0.4.tar.gz">http://boinkor.net/lisp/autobench/autobench-0.4.tar.gz</a>. This version
includes support for benchmarking CMUCL and SBCL. The README should
tell you most of what you need to know.</p>

<p>By the way, it&#8217;s nice to know that the protocol I mentioned in the
<a href="journal#yetanotherbenchmarkentry">2004-11-22 entry</a> is sustainable. The implementation of the benchmark
protocol for cmucl snapshots is about 90 lines of lisp code (which
unfortunately is pretty ugly, due to some suboptimalities in cmucl
snapshot packages).</p>

<p>Now somebody really should add support for CLisp. Hey look, it&#8217;s open
source. (-;</p>
