<p>From the <a href="http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic/">Lovecraft Country Comic (&#8220;Return to Arkham&#8221;)</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>We also have a PDF that you can print, but /.ing is keeping us from making it available right now. Please bookmark this page and check back tomorrow.</blockquote>

<p>Reminds me of <a href="http://www.greylisting.org/">greylisting</a>. So, do slashdot readers really behave like spambots?</p>
