<p>There was a lot of progress in the development of <a href="http://cliki.net/beirc">Beirc</a> since my <a href="http://www.boinkor.net/archives/2005/09/hacking_on_beir.html">last entry</a>. We (splittist, mgr and I) fixed the three most annoying things so far: </p>

<ul>
<li>You no longer have to hit the &#8220;/&#8221; key to be able to click on presentations. It&#8217;s funny how before, everybody said that they don&#8217;t mind hitting &#8220;/&#8221; before reaching for the mouse; but now, I don&#8217;t think anybody would want to go back.</li>
<li>Hitting RET in the middle of a line doesn&#8217;t land you in the debugger, and</li>
<li>Tab completion now works.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, there are dozens of little things that we improved (better message display, useful customizations and defaults, timestamps in columns, more presentations and more clickable things). And of course, there&#8217;s <a href="http://bl0rg.net/~mgr/">mgr</a>&#8217;s wonderful new tab-layout-pane code (<a href="http://boinkor.net/lisp/porn/beirc-2005-09-27.png">lisp porn here</a>).</p>

<p>So, beirc is rapidly becoming an IRC client that I really enjoy using (and, of course, hacking on). Join in the fun on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#beirc">#beirc</a>!</p>
