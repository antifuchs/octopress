##Some Trivia

Born in 1982, connected to the TCP/IP network since 1996. Also known as [asf@boinkor.net](mailto:asf@boinkor.net) or antifuchs on IRC. Beware: I am using [Reverse Smileys (aka left-handed smileys)](/reverse_smileys.html).

##What is Andreas Fuchs doing right now?

To learn what I'm up to as it happens, read my [weblog](http://boinkor.net). Here's a summary: I for a lisp company in the SF Bay Area. Before that, I was consulting on lispy problems (Want me to solve problems for you? send me [e-mail](mailto:asf@boinkor.net).) In my spare time, I enjoy hacking in Common Lisp, building robots, listening to music, listening to and reading and watching good stories.
