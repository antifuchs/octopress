Here's some stuff I've been working on ([github](http://github.com/antifuchs) has the most recent & up-to-date info):

##Common Lisp

* I do some administrative work for the [SBCL](/SBCL.html) project
 * Actual code: a [gdbinit for SBCL](/lisp/sbcl/gdbinit)
* I helped resurrect [iterate](http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/) from the CMU AI repository. Joerg Hoehle and Attila Lendvai are taking good care of it now.
* I wrote a [UBF encoder/decoder](http://common-lisp.net/project/ubf) for Common Lisp when I was bored. ([see](http://www.sics.se/~joe/ubf/site/home.html))
* I wrote [Autobench](/archives/2006/01/sbcl_autobenching_aka_boinkmar.html) to burn CPU cycles on this box.
* A [VT100 screen scraper](screen-scraper.html) I wrote during my time at SILVER SERVER Gmbh was released as Open Source software.

##Non-Lisp hacks

* A gnome [deskbar plugin](/archives/2006/04/a_ssh_plugin_for_deskbarapplet.html) for SSH-ing to hosts
* An [SSH plugin for quicksilver](/archives/2006/11/more_quicksilverification.html).
